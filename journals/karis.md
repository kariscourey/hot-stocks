Today, I worked on:

* Updating API endpoints with team
* Updating db schema with team
* Getting project set up per Learn
* Explore items, explore news items, and explore stocks queries and routers

I updated API endpoints with the team to help minimize confusion and to align with RESTful API routes.

I updated the db schema to reflect optimized datatype selections and the information our wireframe suggests we'll need.

I followed the project setup on Learn to continue fleshing out our project. Struggled a bit with create-multiple-databases and populating one of those databases with data per our schema. Alex and Shelen (SEIRs) came to help, though were unable to resolve issue. On hold with Alex.

I developed query and router code for explore_items, explore_news_items, and explore_stocks.

Today, I worked on:

* Incorporating structure of FastAPI project
* Including code-along users routers and queries code
* Improving API endpoints with team and Candice
* Developing db schema with team

I filled out our project structure following the exploration and lecture pertaining to FastAPI.

I coded along with Dalonte and Candice (instructors) during lecture to have the beginnings of users functionality.

Igneous worked on the schema for hot-stocks-data as a team. We received great input from Candice on our API endpoints to help guide our tables.
