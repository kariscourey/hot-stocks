Today, I worked on:

* Incorporating structure of FastAPI project
* Including code-along users routers and queries code
* Improving API endpoints with team and Candice
* Developing db schema with team

I filled out our project structure following the exploration and lecture pertaining to FastAPI.

I coded along with Dalonte and Candice (instructors) during lecture to have the beginnings of users functionality.

Igneous worked on the schema for hot-stocks-data as a team. We received great input from Candice on our API endpoints to help guide our tables.
